# Ed-Fi Certification Testing

Test scripts for the Ed-Fi Certification process.

In 2024-2025, the Alliance is testing an approach to move from manual validation
with SQL scripts to using the API itself for validation. This approach seeks to
bring in as much automation as possible, using
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) as the platform of choice. The goal of this
is to streamline operations for the Ed-Fi Alliance, speed up development and
certification times for our partners by allowing our partners to perform more of
their own testing.

# Ed-Fi Certification Testing

Test scripts for the Ed-Fi Certification process

In 2024-2025, the Alliance is moving from manual validation with SQL scripts to
using the API itself for validation. This includes bringing in as much
automation as possible, using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) as the
platform of choice. Not only will this streamline operations for the Ed-Fi
Alliance, it will allow our partners to perform more of their own testing.

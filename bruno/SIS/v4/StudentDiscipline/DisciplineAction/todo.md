# DisciplineAction - Documentation Corrections Needed

## Description

The following fields in the DisciplineAction entity documentation are currently marked as REQUIRED but should be marked as OPTIONAL based on the actual API behavior and certification scenario requirements.

## Checklist

- [ ] `studentDisciplineIncidentAssociations` should be marked as OPTIONAL (not REQUIRED)
- [ ] `studentDisciplineIncidentAssociationReference` should be marked as OPTIONAL (not REQUIRED)
- [ ] `iepPlacementMeetingIndicator` should be marked as OPTIONAL (not REQUIRED)

## Next Steps

These corrections need to be applied to the official Ed-Fi API documentation and the corresponding scenario example data table in `folder.bru`.

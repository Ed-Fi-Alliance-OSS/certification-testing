# StudentDisciplineIncidentBehaviorAssociation - Documentation Corrections Needed

## Description

The following fields in the `StudentDisciplineIncidentBehaviorAssociation` entity documentation should be applied based on the actual API behavior.

## Checklist

- [ ] `behaviors` should be REMOVED since it does not exists in the model
- [ ] `studentParticipationCodeDescriptor` should REMOVED since it does not exists in the model
- [ ] `disciplineIncidentParticipationCodes` should be ADDED instead of `studentParticipationCodeDescriptor`
- [ ] `disciplineIncidentParticipationCodes` should be ADDED instead of `disciplineIncidentParticipationCodeDescriptor`

> The corresponding adjustments were made to the current scenario, but are still pending in the official documentation.

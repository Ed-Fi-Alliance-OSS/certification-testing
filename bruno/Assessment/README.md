# Assessment Bruno Collection

Certification and validation tests focused on assessment-related Ed-Fi resources.

## Local Dependencies
Maintains its own `node_modules` because Bruno sandbox prevents parent directory resolution. Present dependency:
- `dayjs`

## Utilities
If/when a `utils.js` is added here, copy it from another collection and keep synchronized.

## Install Additional Dependencies
```
npm install <package>
```

## Batch Updates
Use repository root script `update-collection-deps.ps1`.
